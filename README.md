# ChessKnightEmulator

#### Problem Description
>Create Android application (Java or Kotlin- optional) that should render an empty chessboard where the user will be able to mark a starting position and an ending position.
>The app should then render a list of all possible paths that one knight (αλογάκι) piece in the starting position could take to  reach the ending position in 3 moves.
>Some inputs might not have a solution, in this case the program should display a message that no solution has been found.  The user should be able to reset the board and 
>start again. How the application will render the paths is up to you (e.g. render the paths using lines of different color,present a list of the moves in algebraic chess
>notation, animation of the knight along the path). The rendered chessboard could be of any size NxN where   6<=N<=16.
